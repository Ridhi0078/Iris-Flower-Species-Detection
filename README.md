# Iris Species Detection using SVM

This project demonstrates how Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm, can be applied to classify Iris flower species based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using the well-known Iris dataset from scikit-learn, the model is trained to distinguish between three species ‚Äî Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica ‚Äî with high accuracy. This project focuses on model training, evaluation, and visualization to provide a clear understanding of SVM classification in action.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict the species of an Iris flower ‚Äî *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* ‚Äî based on four features.
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Dataset:** Built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`

## Dataset Features

The dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `species` (target class: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
